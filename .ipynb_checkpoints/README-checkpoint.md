Reason for Picking MIT License and CoC
-----

This program is really simple, I think anything simple as this should be very open and permissive. Also I want to line up the licenses with github since and program is done on github.

There is not much about Code of Conduct for this program, because there is not many "conducts" could be done to the pregram. I just want people to be nice to each other, and send warm greetings to people, just like this program does.
